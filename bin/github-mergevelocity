    github-mergevelocity --url oalders/html-restrict

=head1 ARGS

=head2 url

Expects an URL to a Github repository.  Multiple C<--url> args can be supplied.

    github-mergevelocity --url oalders/html-restrict --url https://github.com/neilbowers/PAUSE-Packages

An url can be a proper URL to a git repo or even as succinct as
'username/repository-name'.

    github-mergevelocity --url oalders/html-restrict

If you're really lazy, you can even paste in an entire url which contains the
repo in it.  Be creative!

    github-mergevelocity --url https://github.com/neilbowers/PAUSE-Packages/issues

=head2 github-user

API limits.  In most cases this won't be an issue.

=head2 github-token

An API token for your Github account.  You'll need this if you're hitting
Github API limits.  In most cases this won't be an issue.  See
L<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use>
for more information.

=head2 cache-requests
